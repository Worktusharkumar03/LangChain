# AI Research Assistant

A LangChain project that lets you ask research questions, performs web search, and summarizes results using LLMs and tools/agents.

## 🚀 What You Learn
- How to use LangChain tools and agents
- How to integrate web search into LLM workflows
- How to summarize and synthesize information from multiple sources
- How to build a Streamlit UI for research Q&A

## 🛠️ What We Do
1. User asks a research question
2. Agent performs web search (SerpAPI or similar)
